\"The mighty Lord Gizzard invites you and your court to a negotiation/tennis tournament/go-kart racing weekend at the Dark Spire, in the heart of the Kingdom of Mischief.
\"There shall be a banquet on the first day, filled with whatever disgusting sugary treats you people call food.
\"Cross that off, she'd take offense to that. Filled with cakes, sweets, et cetera.
\"Also, if you don't come I'm going to declare war on your kingdom.
\"From,
\"Lord Gizzard
